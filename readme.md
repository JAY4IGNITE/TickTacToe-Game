# Tic Tac Toe Game Using C++

## Overview

This project is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented using C++. It allows two players to play the game alternately on a 3×3 board. The program manages user input, validates moves, updates the board, checks for winning conditions, and declares the result.

This project is designed to demonstrate basic C++ programming concepts and structured problem-solving.

## Features

- Two-player game support
- Console-based interactive interface
- Input validation for valid moves
- Automatic win detection
